## Frontiers | Corporate Decarbonization Strategies and Carbon Accounting Standards: Implementation Learnings to Inform Standard Revisions

*Source*: Frontiers

The article discusses corporate strategies for decarbonization and their alignment with carbon accounting standards, focusing on renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) and supplier engagement initiatives. It highlights that over 11,000 companies have committed to reducing emissions using the GHG Protocol. PPAs are favored for their clear recognition in accounting standards and minimal impact on core operations, despite rising costs and complexity. Supplier engagement programs, although supported by initiatives like the Science Based Targets Initiative, face challenges in reducing Scope 3 emissions due to data mismatches and high transaction costs. The article stresses the need for standard setters to consider practical implementation issues during revisions to enhance the effectiveness of GHG emissions accounting and target-setting systems. This would lead to more significant reductions in atmospheric emissions.

## Carbon Accounting That Helps Companies Shift to Clean Energy Faster - RMI

*Source*: RMI

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is reforming its carbon accounting standards and has introduced a sub-working group focused on consequential emissions assessment in the electricity sector. This new approach aims to directly connect emissions reporting to actual climate impact, particularly for Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity. While most companies currently use attributional accounting, which allocates emissions responsibility but doesn't measure real climate impact, consequential assessment evaluates how a company's actions change total greenhouse gas emissions. This method can guide corporate strategies to more effectively mitigate emissions by assessing the real-world impact of actions like signing solar power purchase agreements or investing in grid storage. Unlike attributional accounting, consequential assessment can also serve as a forward-looking tool to predict the impact of future actions. For example, a company like Purple Production Co. could use consequential assessment to choose between two solar PPAs, considering the actual emissions impact of each option based on their location relative to coal or gas plants. This approach could lead to more effective emissions reduction strategies than current attributional methods.

## Decoding Chinaâ€™s Carbon Accounting Plan: Compliance and Opportunities

*Source*: China Briefing

China has unveiled a new Work Plan for Improving the Carbon Emission Statistics and Accounting System, a key document supporting its dual carbon goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Released by the National Development and Reform Commission and other departments, the plan aims to establish a comprehensive carbon emission reporting and accounting system by 2025, with full implementation by 2030. This system will include a national and provincial annual and interim reporting framework and a national greenhouse gas emission factor database.

The Work Plan emphasizes the urgency for businesses to develop internal carbon accounting capabilities to meet new compliance requirements. It also presents opportunities for sectors involved in low-carbon technology research, emissions consulting, and carbon footprint calculation services.

China's efforts to enhance its carbon accounting system have been ongoing since 2022 and align with broader goals to transition to a green economy. Accurate carbon data is essential for effective emissions management, informed policymaking, and tracking progress toward climate goals. This initiative is expected to drive innovation and encourage businesses to adopt more sustainable practices.

The plan addresses previous shortcomings in carbon emission statistics and accounting, detailing tasks and responsibilities to improve data quality and timeliness across various sectors and levels. By 2025, China aims to have a robust system in place to support its ambitious climate targets.

## As the GHG Protocol eyes the homestretch in its Scope 2 revisions, are the right voices being heard? | Utility Dive

*Source*: Utility Dive

Roger Ballentine, president of Green Strategies, highlights the importance of the upcoming updates to the Greenhouse Gas Protocolâ€™s Scope 2 rules, which guide corporate investments in clean energy. Since the Scope 2 Guidance was first issued in 2015, corporate investments have significantly boosted renewable energy deployment. However, with federal support for clean energy waning and electricity demand rising, maintaining the voluntary market's growth is crucial.

Currently, the Protocol's Technical Working Group is considering proposals that could change the way companies match their electricity consumption with clean energy purchases. These proposals include requiring hourly matching and limiting procurements to narrow geographic boundaries, known as "24/7" accounting. Many stakeholders, including Ballentine, believe these changes could hinder the voluntary market.

Green Strategies conducted a survey with nearly 100 leading companies in the voluntary market to assess the potential impact of these changes. The survey explored three scenarios: smaller market boundaries, smaller boundaries with hourly matching, and changes in emissions impact reporting.

1. **Smaller Market Boundaries**: 70% of respondents indicated that stricter boundaries would disqualify their current procurement contracts. In markets without retail choice, procurement would become significantly more challenging for many respondents.

2. **Smaller Boundaries and Hourly Matching**: While hourly matching could boost demand for firm clean resources, nearly 80% of respondents doubted their ability to procure time-matched clean electricity within smaller boundaries.

3. **Better Accounting for Impact**: Adding new impact disclosure options could incentivize companies to increase their grid decarbonization impact. About 60% of respondents believed that flexibility in procurement boundaries would enhance their carbon reduction efforts.

The disconnect between the working group's proposals and stakeholder views suggests a need to reconsider the update process. Over the coming months, it is crucial to ensure that the voices of those investing in clean energy are heard and considered.

## Renewable energy buyers should brush up on Scope 2 revisions

*Source*: Trellis Group

The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol is revising its emissions accounting rules, specifically for Scope 2 emissions related to energy purchases, which could complicate the process for companies claiming reductions through corporate renewable energy contracts. These changes may particularly impact companies with smaller electricity loads or distributed operations. The GHG Protocol, which provides guidelines used by 97% of companies for greenhouse gas emissions reporting, is updating its rules following feedback from two years ago. The current Scope 2 guidance, last updated in 2015, allows companies to claim emissions reductions by purchasing renewable energy certificates from zero-carbon sources, regardless of their location.

Proposed changes include more rigorous requirements, such as matching electricity loads to renewable sources on an hourly basis for large consumers and narrowing market boundaries to regional grids. These revisions aim to enhance the integrity of corporate claims about renewable electricity purchases. However, influential trade groups like the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) and the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) have expressed concerns that these changes could deter corporate investments in clean energy. They argue that making the revisions mandatory could pose significant implementation challenges, especially for smaller companies or those new to renewable procurement.

Corporate renewable buyers suggest that future rules should be tiered and some elements made optional to avoid discouraging participation. They emphasize the need for more meaningful procurement beyond just annual matching. A survey conducted by CEBA indicates that 80% of clean electricity practitioners lack confidence in complying with the proposed changes. This uncertainty, coupled with broader economic conditions, is causing hesitation in the market. CEBA and ACORE urge the GHG Protocol to seek more input from corporate practitioners and renewables developers as the revisions are finalized.

## Briefing: 24/7 renewable electricity matching is a far more credible approach for the GHG Protocol and the SBTi than the Emissions First Partnership proposal | NewClimate Institute

*Source*: NewClimate Institute

The Q&A briefing discusses the importance of 24/7 renewable electricity matching and critiques the Emissions First Partnership (EFP) proposals. The briefing is a collaboration among several organizations, including NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch. It highlights the Climate Groupâ€™s 24/7 Carbon-free Coalition, supported by companies like Google and Vodafone, which encourages matching electricity consumption with local renewable generation on an hourly basis. This approach contrasts with the EFP, backed by Amazon and Meta, which suggests loosening current rules and is criticized as a repackaging of controversial offsetting models.

The briefing also covers the ongoing revision of the GHG Protocol, particularly its Scope 2 Guidance, which influences corporate climate action transparency and integrity. The revision, expected to conclude by 2026, is crucial for improving accuracy in emissions accounting. The debate centers around renewable electricity accounting, with the 24/7 matching approach seen as more effective in driving decarbonization compared to the EFPâ€™s proposals.

24/7 matching supports the energy transition by ensuring companies match their electricity use with local renewable generation on an hourly basis, rather than annually. This approach encourages the development of new renewable energy technologies and storage, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and can lead to efficiency improvements. It also necessitates corporate advocacy for policies that support renewable energy development.

## How Californiaâ€™s Climate Disclosure Law Impacts Lenders in Subscription Credit Facilities | Insights | Mayer Brown

*Source*: Mayer Brown

California's Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (SB-253), part of the state's Climate Accountability Package, mandates that U.S. companies doing business in California with over $1 billion in global revenue disclose their Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This law affects subscription credit facility lenders (SCF Lenders) by potentially requiring them to disclose GHG emissions linked to their loan portfolios, known as financed emissions. The law's requirements are guided by the GHG Protocol, which currently makes reporting on financed emissions optional unless the SCF Lender knows the specific use of proceeds at the portfolio company level.

A lawsuit filed by business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, challenges the constitutionality of SB-253 and another related law, arguing they violate the First Amendment and impose undue burdens on commerce. Despite these legal challenges, SCF Lenders should prepare for compliance with SB-253's requirements.

Governor Newsom proposed amendments to delay initial reporting deadlines, but these were not enacted. Instead, the California legislature passed SB-219, giving the California Air Resources Board (CARB) more time to publish regulations and set the schedule for Scope 3 emissions disclosures, with initial reporting expected by 2027. SCF Lenders should continue monitoring these developments and any guidance on Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements.

## EU downsizes and delays its climate disclosure policy - Competitive Enterprise Institute

*Source*: Competitive Enterprise Institute

The European Union (EU) is reassessing its climate disclosure policy, particularly the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive (CSRD). The European Commission has scaled back the directive, which initially required companies to report on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities across 12 categories. The implementation of the CSRD and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CS3D) has been delayed, with large enterprises and parent firms facing postponed reporting requirements, and small- and medium-sized enterprises now starting in 2029 instead of 2027.

A new omnibus bill proposed by the European Commission would significantly reduce the scope of these regulations. The compliance threshold has been raised to firms with 1,000 or more employees, exempting 80% of the originally targeted companies, including many US-based firms operating in Europe. This downsizing addresses concerns about the directive's burdensome nature and high compliance costs, estimated at $8.09 billion for 50,000 firms, far exceeding similar mandates in California and the US SEC.

The CSRD's complexity, particularly the Scope 3 emissions reporting requirement, has made it difficult for EU member states to codify the directive into law. As of April 2025, only 20 of 27 member countries had partially codified it. Scope 3 reporting, which involves tracking emissions across a company's entire value chain, is challenging and costly. The proposed reductions would alleviate some of these burdens, especially for overseas firms.

The directive also mandates costly assurance reports, requiring independent audits of sustainability reports. The omnibus bill proposes reducing the assurance standard from reasonable to limited, easing compliance. These changes aim to relieve companies from the EU's extensive climate disclosure requirements while still promoting transparency.

## EU climate disclosure requirements are set to be scaled back.

*Source*: Trellis Group

The European Union's Omnibus Simplification Package, intended to streamline corporate disclosure requirements like the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), is set for public release soon. However, a leaked amendment suggests significant reductions in corporate disclosure obligations, sparking criticism from industry professionals who view it as deregulation rather than simplification.

The package aims to simplify the EU's three main corporate emissions data requirements to ease reporting burdens. These include the CSRD, the EU Taxonomy Regulation, and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. The leaked amendment proposes relaxing the CSRD's qualifying standards, reducing the number of companies required to comply by about 85%, now focusing on companies with 1,000 or more employees, compared to the current threshold of 250 employees. Small and medium-sized entities, both within and outside the EU, would be exempt.

The amendment also proposes delaying the Due Diligence Directive's implementation from July 2026 to January 2027 and reducing its requirements. It would limit due diligence to direct stakeholders and remove the mandate for companies to create climate transition plans.

Critics argue that these changes prioritize short-term cost reductions over long-term benefits. The finalized version of the omnibus package will be released soon, and further updates on EU corporate emissions disclosure requirements are anticipated.

## What businesses are disclosing under the CSRD | PwC

*Source*: PwC

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is designed to enhance sustainability reporting by requiring companies to disclose reliable information on material sustainability-related impacts, risks, and opportunities (IROs) throughout their value chains. This involves a double materiality assessment, which considers both financial materiality (business impacts) and impact materiality (effects on people and the environment).

In February 2025, the European Commission proposed changes to the CSRD as part of an Omnibus package to simplify sustainability regulations. These changes would reduce the number of organizations under the CSRD's scope and simplify reporting obligations, although the core principle of double materiality remains unchanged.

The directive is supported by 12 European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which include two cross-cutting standards and ten topical standards covering environmental, social, and governance matters. Companies must report on each IRO identified and their plans to address them.

CSRD reporting applies to listed EU companies and certain unlisted EU companies, including subsidiaries of non-EU companies. Those currently under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) must start reporting for financial years from 1 January 2024, with initial reports due in 2025 (Wave 1). Other unlisted EU companies must report from 2027 (Wave 2), and listed SMEs, certain financial institutions, and non-EU entities with significant EU activities must report from 2028 (Wave 3).

The Omnibus proposals aim to simplify reporting by reducing mandatory data points and removing a planned shift from 'limited assurance' to 'reasonable assurance.' They also increase company size thresholds, excluding many small and midsized companies from the CSRD's scope. Voluntary reporting is encouraged through the EU-supported VSME standard for non-listed micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.

## FASBâ€™s draft rules could harm environmental credit markets: Environmental Defense Fund | ESG Dive

*Source*: ESG Dive

The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and other stakeholders have provided feedback on proposed U.S. accounting guidance for carbon offset credits and climate-related financial instruments. The EDF, along with 36 other organizations including major accounting firms and corporations like General Motors and Ford, submitted comments during the public comment period. The guidance, known as Topic 818, aims to provide specific accounting direction for environmental credits and obligations, which are not currently covered under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

While the EDF commends the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for offering much-needed guidance, it suggests revisions to avoid harming environmental credit markets. Specifically, the EDF recommends treating non-refundable deposits for future credit purchases as intangible assets, aligning with International Financial Reporting Standards, and avoiding immediate expense recognition, which could disincentivize corporate sustainability projects.

The EDF also proposes that companies generating environmental credits should be allowed to capitalize development costs as inventory, rather than as intangible assets, to better reflect the economic fundamentals of environmental credit markets.

The Center for Environmental Accountability (CEA) also raised concerns, cautioning against misleading representations of environmental credits and suggesting that only credits from government-created programs should be treated as assets. They also highlight potential issues with international credits, such as those from the EU Emissions Trading System, especially in light of past U.S. federal policy shifts.

Corporations, like Ford, expressed concerns about disclosure requirements and liability measurement, which could affect competitiveness and cause income statement volatility. The FASB will review all comments in a future meeting, having prioritized environmental credits in its technical agenda since May 2022.

## Here Come New Rules on Environmental Credits for Businesses

*Source*: Globest

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has approved an update to its accounting standard titled "Environmental Credits and Environmental Credit Obligations." This update addresses various assets like credits, certificates, allowances, and offsets aimed at managing emissions and pollution. These environmental credits are defined as non-physical, non-financial assets that can be transferred in exchange transactions, excluding tax credits meant for settling tax liabilities. The new guidance seeks to close a gap in accounting practices, providing investors with clearer methods for assessing the financial impact of these credits. If ratified, the changes will be effective for annual reporting periods starting after December 15, 2027, but they still require final approval.

Under the new rules, companies must recognize environmental credits as assets on their balance sheets and record nonrefundable deposits for these credits as expenses. The credits must be externally generated and recorded at their original cost. FASB has simplified disclosure requirements, eliminating the need for detailed descriptions and classifications of environmental credit obligations in financial statements. Additionally, disclosures about program descriptions, jurisdictional data, and the breakdown of liabilities are no longer required, nor is separate reporting of revenue from sales contracts and gains or losses from sales.

FASB Chairman Rich Jones supports the update for its potential to improve transparency. However, board member Christine Botosan abstained from the vote, expressing concerns about whether the benefits justify the costs. This update comes amid ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to dismantle energy credit initiatives from the Biden era, highlighting continued pressure on public energy programs.

## FASBâ€™s draft rules could harm environmental credit markets, EDF says | CFO Dive

*Source*: CFO Dive

The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and other organizations have raised concerns about proposed U.S. accounting guidance for carbon offset credits and climate-related financial instruments, suggesting revisions to avoid harming environmental credit markets. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) update, known as Topic 818, aims to provide specific guidance where current GAAP is lacking, covering emissions allowances, CAFE credits, renewable identification numbers, and renewable energy certificates.

EDF commended the FASB for offering industry-specific guidance but highlighted areas needing revision. They suggested that non-refundable deposits for future credit purchases should be recorded as deposits and reclassified as intangible assets when received, aligning better with International Financial Reporting Standards and showcasing proactive sustainability investments. This approach would also prevent potential negative economic impacts from immediate expense recognition, which might discourage corporate support for sustainability projects.

EDF also proposed that companies generating environmental credits for sale should use an inventory accounting model, allowing capitalization of development costs as part of inventory costs, rather than the current intangible asset model which doesn't allow this.

The Center for Environmental Accountability (CEA) warned against misleading representations of environmental credits and recommended that only credits from government-created programs be treated as assets. They also expressed concerns about the implications of the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the Trump administration on accounting for international credits.

Corporations like Ford Motor Co. also expressed concerns, particularly about competitive implications of disclosure requirements and the potential for income statement volatility due to liability measurement requirements.

The FASB will review all comments in a future meeting, having added environmental credits to its high-priority agenda in May 2022.
