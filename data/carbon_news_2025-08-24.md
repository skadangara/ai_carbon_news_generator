## Frontiers | Corporate Decarbonization Strategies and Carbon Accounting Standards: Implementation Learnings to Inform Standard Revisions

*Source*: Frontiers

The article discusses corporate strategies for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, focusing on renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) and supplier engagement initiatives. Over 11,000 companies have committed to reducing emissions using the GHG Protocol standards. The paper evaluates how these strategies align with existing carbon accounting standards and considers factors like internal approval processes, business impacts, and transaction costs. PPAs are preferred due to their clear recognition in accounting standards and minimal disruption to business operations, despite increasing costs and complexity. Supplier engagement programs, although supported by initiatives like the Science Based Targets Initiative, face challenges in reducing Scope 3 emissions due to data mismatches and high transaction costs. The article emphasizes the need for standard setters to incorporate practical implementation insights to improve the effectiveness of voluntary GHG emissions accounting and target-setting systems, aiming for more substantial reductions in emissions.

## Carbon Accounting That Helps Companies Shift to Clean Energy Faster - RMI

*Source*: RMI

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which provides carbon accounting standards for over 90% of Fortune 500 companies, has initiated a sub-working group focused on consequential emissions assessment in the electricity sector. This group aims to develop a standardized tool for evaluating the carbon impact of corporate actions, known as consequential assessment, particularly for Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity. Unlike the current attributional accounting methods that allocate emissions responsibility among consumers, consequential assessment measures the actual impact of actions on greenhouse gas emissions.

Attributional accounting divides emissions within a boundary, such as an electricity system, among consumers based on certain rules. It helps companies report emissions associated with their electricity supply and supports claims of using carbon-free power. However, it does not directly measure the real-world impact of actions, meaning that changes in reported emissions do not necessarily equate to actual greenhouse gas reductions. This disconnect can lead to actions that appear beneficial on paper but have varying real-world impacts, or overlook impactful actions like investments in grid storage or in regions outside a company's operations.

Consequential accounting, on the other hand, assesses how a company's actions affect total emissions by estimating the difference in emissions if the actions had not occurred. This approach can evaluate the impact of various actions, such as signing solar power purchase agreements (PPAs) or implementing demand response programs, which are not fully captured by current attributional systems. It also serves as both a backward-looking measurement and a forward-looking risk assessment tool.

For example, a fictional company, Purple Production Co., considering two solar PPAs in Pennsylvania, would find both options equivalent under attributional accounting. However, consequential assessment could reveal differing impacts based on the local energy mix, such as coal versus gas, helping the company choose the more effective strategy for reducing emissions. Consequently, while attributional inventories remain essential, consequential assessment offers a way for companies to better understand and strategize their emissions reduction efforts.

## Decoding Chinaâ€™s Carbon Accounting Plan: Compliance and Opportunities

*Source*: China Briefing

China has introduced a new Work Plan for Improving the Carbon Emission Statistics and Accounting System, which is a key document supporting the country's dual carbon goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Released on October 24, 2024, by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other departments, the plan outlines the development of a comprehensive carbon emission reporting system by 2025 and a full accounting system by 2030. This initiative is crucial for accurate carbon measurement, informed policymaking, and tracking progress towards China's climate targets.

The Work Plan mandates the creation of national and provincial annual and interim reporting systems for carbon emissions and a national greenhouse gas emission factor database by 2025. This will facilitate more accurate and consistent data collection, enabling better regulatory compliance and encouraging businesses to adopt greener practices. The plan is also expected to spur innovation in low-carbon technologies and services, such as emission consulting and carbon footprint calculation.

China's efforts to establish a robust carbon accounting system began in 2022, with significant policy developments and the issuance of guidance on carbon measurement parameters. The Work Plan addresses previous shortcomings, assigns clear responsibilities, and enhances implementation across various sectors. This initiative is foundational for China to achieve its ambitious climate goals, ensuring that efforts are data-driven and effective.

## Lack of harmonisation of greenhouse gases reporting standards and the methane emissions gap | Nature Communications

*Source*: Nature

The article examines how companies report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, focusing on Scope 1 emissions, using data from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) between 2014 and 2023. The study highlights the variability in how companies report emissions due to fragmented guidelines, particularly regarding the Global Warming Potential (GWP) metrics used to convert methane emissions to CO2 equivalent (CO2e) units. The dataset includes 14,077 companies from 120 countries, with a significant increase in reporting over time. However, only a smaller subset reports methane emissions explicitly and uses metrics from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports (AR).

The study finds that the average GWP used by companies is often lower than the most recent IPCC guidance, with some companies still using outdated metrics from the Second AR of 1995. Most companies (82%-90%) use a 100-year time horizon for GWP, aligning with the GHG Protocol's recommendations. The article introduces the concept of a "methane conversion gap," which measures the difference between reported methane emissions and those calculated using a harmonized standard, such as the most recent GWP100. This gap suggests that reported emissions are generally lower than they would be under a standardized metric, highlighting the impact of accounting optionality on methane emission monitoring. The study uses the most recent GWP100 as a baseline for comparison, consistent with GHG protocol guidelines and IPCC recommendations.
